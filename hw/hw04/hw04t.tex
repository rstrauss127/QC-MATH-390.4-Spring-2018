\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out.''  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read about all the concepts introduced in class online e.g. multivariate least squares linear modeling, orthogonal projections, non-linear linear regression, stepwise linear regression, non-parametric regression, regression trees, classification trees, performance characteristics of binary classification, etc. This is your responsibility to supplement in-class with your own readings. Also, read ch 3--6 in Silver.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems. 

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 10 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. The easiest way to use overleaf is to copy the raw text from hwxx.tex \emph{and} preamble.tex into two new overleaf tex files with the same name. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks which are \textit{not} on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records.

\problem{This question is about ridge regression --- an alternative to OLS.}


\begin{enumerate}

\intermediatesubproblem{Imagine we are in the \qu{Luis situation} where we have $\X$ with dimension $n \times (p+1)$ but $p+1 > n$ and we still want to do OLS. Why would the OLS solution we found previously break down in this case?}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{We will embark now to provide a solution for this case. The solution will also give nice results for other situations besides the Luis situation as well. First, assume $\lambda$ is a positive constant and demonstrate that the expression $\lambda \normsq{\w} = \w^\top (\lambda \I) \w$ i.e. it can be expressed as a quadratic form where $\lambda\I$ is the determining matrix. We will call this term $\lambda \normsq{\w}$ the \qu{ridge penalty}.}\spc{3}


\easysubproblem{Write the $\mathcal{H}$ for OLS below where there parameter is the $\w$ vector. $\w \in$ ?}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Write the error objective function that OLS minimizes using vectors, then expand the terms similar to the previous homework assignment.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Now add the ridge penalty $\lambda \normsq{\w}$ to the expanded form you just found and write it below. We will term this two-part error function the \qu{ridge objective}.}\spc{1}

\easysubproblem{Note that the ridge objective looks a bit like the hinge loss we spoke about when we were learning about support vector machines. There are two pieces of this error function in counterbalance. When this is minimized, describe conceptually what is going on.}\spc{5}

\intermediatesubproblem{Now, the ridge penalty term as a quadratic form can be combined with the last term in the least squares error from OLS. Do this, then use the rules of vector derivatives we learned to take $d/d\w$ and write the answer below.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{Now set that derivative equal to zero. What matrix needs to be invertible to solve?}\spc{2}

\hardsubproblem{There's a theorem that says \textit{positive definite} matrices are invertible. A matrix is said to be positive definite if every quadratic form is positive for all vectors i.e. if $\forall \z \neq \zerovec~~ \z^\top A \z > 0$ then $A$ is positive definite. Prove this matrix from the previous question is positive definite.}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{Now that it's positive definite (and thus invertible), solve for the $\w$ that is the argmin of the ridge objective, call it $\b_{ridge}$. Note that this is called the \qu{ridge estimator} and computing it is called \qu{ridge regression} and it was invented by Hoerl and Kennard in 1970.}\spc{3}


\easysubproblem{Did we just figure out a way out of Luis's situation? Explain.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{It turns out in the Luis situation, many of the values of the entries of $\b_{ridge}$ are close to 0. Why should that be? Can you explain now conceptually how ridge regression works?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Find $\yhat$ as a function of $\y$ using $\b_{ridge}$. Is $\yhat$ an orthogonal projection of $\y$ onto the column space of $\X$?}\spc{3}

\extracreditsubproblem{Show that this $\yhat$ is an orthogonal projection of $\y$ onto the column space of some matrix $\X_{ridge}$ (which is not $\X$!) and explain how to construct $\X_{ridge}$ on a separate page.}\spc{0}

\easysubproblem{Is the $\mathcal{H}$ for OLS the same as the $\mathcal{H}$ for ridge regression? Yes/no. \\ Is the $\mathcal{A}$ for OLS the same as the $\mathcal{A}$ for ridge regression? Yes/no.}\spc{-0.5}

\intermediatesubproblem{What is a good way to pick the value of $\lambda$, the hyperparameter of the $\mathcal{A}$ = ridge?}\spc{1}




\easysubproblem{In classification via $\mathcal{A}$ = support vector machines with hinge loss, how should we pick the value of $\lambda$? Hint: same as previous question!}\spc{1}



\extracreditsubproblem{Besides the Luis situation, in what other situations will ridge regression save the day?}\spc{3}


\hardsubproblem{The ridge penalty is beautiful because you were able to take the derivative and get an analytical solution. Consider the following algorithm:

\beqn
\b_{lasso} = \argmin_{\w~\in~\reals^{p + 1}} \braces{(\y - \X\w)^\top(\y - \X\w) + \lambda \norm{\w}^1}
\eeqn

This penalty is called the \qu{lasso penalty} and it is different from the ridge penalty in that it is not the norm of $\w$ squared but just the norm of $\w$. It turns out this algorithm (even though it has no closed form analytic solution and must be solved numerically a la the SVM) is very useful! In \qu{lasso regression} the values of $\b_{lasso}$ are not shrunk \textit{towards} 0 they are harshly punished \textit{directly to} 0! How do you think lasso regression would be useful in data science? Feel free to look at the Internet and write a few sentences below.}~\spc{6}

\easysubproblem{Is the $\mathcal{H}$ for OLS the same as the $\mathcal{H}$ for lasso regression? Yes/no. \\ Is the $\mathcal{A}$ for OLS the same as the $\mathcal{A}$ for lasso regression? Yes/no.}\spc{-0.5}

\end{enumerate}

\problem{These are questions about non-parametric regression.}


\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{In problem 1, we talked about schemes to validate algorithms which tried $M$ different prespecified models. Where did these models come from?}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{What is the weakness in using $M$ pre-specified models?}\spc{5}

\hardsubproblem{Explain the steps clearly in forward stepwise linear regression.}\spc{6}

\hardsubproblem{Explain the steps clearly in \emph{backwards} stepwise linear regression.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{What is the weakness(es) in this stepwise procedure?}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{Define \qu{non-parametric regression}. What problem(s) does it solve? What are its goals? Discuss.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{Provide the steps for the regression tree (the one algorithm we discussed in class) below.}\spc{10}


\easysubproblem{Consider the following data 

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{curvy}
\end{figure}

Create a tree with maximum depth 1 (i.e one split at the root node) and plot $g$ above.}~\spc{4}


\easysubproblem{Now add a second split to the tree and plot $g$ below.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\includegraphics[width=3in]{curvy}
\end{figure}

\easysubproblem{Now add a third split to the tree and plot $g$ below.

\begin{figure}[htp]

\includegraphics[width=3in]{curvy}
\end{figure}

}~\spc{5}


\easysubproblem{Now add a fourth split to the tree and plot $g$ below.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{curvy}
\end{figure}

}~\spc{-0.5}

\easysubproblem{Draw a tree diagram of $g$ below indicating which nodes are the root, inner nodes and leaves. Indicate split rules and leaf values clearly.}\spc{15}



\easysubproblem{Plot $g$ below for the mature tree with the default $N_0 =$ \texttt{nodesize} hyperparameter.

\begin{figure}[htp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3in]{curvy}
\end{figure}

}~\spc{-0.5}


\easysubproblem{If $N_0 =1$, what would likely go wrong?}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{How should you pick the $N_0 =$ \texttt{nodesize} hyperparameter in practice?}\spc{2}


\end{enumerate}

\intermediatesubproblem{What are the steps in the classification tree algorithm?}\spc{12}


\end{enumerate}

\problem{These are questions about measuring performance of a classifier.}

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{What is a confusion table?}\spc{8}


Consider the following in-sample confusion table where \qu{$>50$K} is the positive class:

\begin{Verbatim}
       y_hats_train
y_train <=50K >50K
  <=50K  3475  262
  >50K    471  792
\end{Verbatim}

\easysubproblem{Calculate the following: $n$ (sample size) = \\~\\
$FP$ (false positives) = \\~\\
$TP$ (true positives) = \\~\\
$FN$ (false negatives) = \\~\\
$TN$ (true negatives) = \\~\\

}

\easysubproblem{Why is FPR also called the \qu{false alarm rate}?}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{Why is FNR also called the \qu{miss rate}?}\spc{4}

\begin{enumerate}

\intermediatesubproblem{If one's goal is to fit a model for a phenomenon $y$, what is the difference between the approaches of the hedgehog and the fox?

\end{enumerate}

\problem{These are questions about multivariate linear model fitting using the least squares algorithm.}

\begin{enumerate}

\hardsubproblem{Derive $\partialop{\c}{\c^\top A \c}$ where $\c \in \reals^n$ and $A \in \reals^{n \times n}$ but \textit{not} symmetric. Get as far as you can.}\spc{8}

No need to rederive the facts about vector derivatives.}\spc{10}

\intermediatesubproblem{Consider the case where $p = 1$. Show that the solution for $\b$ you just derived is the same solution that we proved for simple regression in Lecture 8. That is, the first element of $\b$ is the same as $b_0 = \ybar - r \frac{s_y}{s_x}\xbar$ and the second element of $\b$ is $b_1 = r \frac{s_y}{s_x}$.} \spc{10}

\easysubproblem{If $X$ is rank deficient, how can you solve for $\b$? Explain in English.} \spc{2}

As an example, previously the mistake for the 17th observation was $e_{17} := y_{17} - \hat{y}_{17}$ but now it would be $e_{17} := c_{17} (y_{17} - \hat{y}_{17})$.  Derive the weighted least squares solution $\b$. No need to rederive the facts about vector derivatives. Hints: (1) show that SSE is a quadratic form with the matrix $C$ in the middle (2) Split this matrix up into two pieces i.e. $C = C^{\half} C^{\half}$, distribute and then foil (3) note that a scalar value equals its own transpose and (4) use the vector derivative formulas.}\spc{20}

\intermediatesubproblem{Prove that the point $<1,\xbar_1, \xbar_2, \ldots, \xbar_p, \bar{y}>$ is a point on the least squares linear solution.}\spc{13}

\end{enumerate}

\problem{These are questions related to the concept of orthogonal projection, QR decomposition and its relationship with least squares linear modeling.}

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{Consider least squares linear regression using a design matrix $X$ with rank $p + 1$. What are the degrees of freedom in the resulting model? What does this mean?}\spc{3}


\intermediatesubproblem{If you are orthogonally projecting the vector $\y$ onto the column space of $X$ which is of rank $p + 1$, derive the formula for $\proj{\colsp{X}}{\y}$. Is this the same as the least squares solution?}\spc{6}

\hardsubproblem{We saw that the perceptron is an \textit{iterative algorithm}. This means that it goes through multiple iterations in order to converge to a closer and closer $\w$. Why not do the same with linear least squares regression? Consider the following. Regress $\y$ using $\X$ to get $\yhat$. This generates residuals $\e$ (the leftover piece of $\y$ that wasn't explained by the regression's fit, $\yhat$). Now try again! Regress $\e$ using $\X$ and then get new residuals $\e_{new}$. Would $\e_{new}$ be closer to $\zerovec_n$ than the first $\e$? That is, wouldn't this yield a better model on iteration \#2? Yes/no and explain.}\spc{10}


\intermediatesubproblem{Prove that $Q^\top = Q^{-1}$ where $Q$ is an orthonormal matrix such that $\colsp{Q} = \colsp{X}$ and $Q$ and $X$ are both matrices $\in \reals^{n \times (p+1)}$. Hint: this is purely a linear algebra exercise.}\spc{10}


\intermediatesubproblem{Prove that the least squares projection $H = \XXtXinvXt$ is the same as $QQ^\top$.}\spc{10}

\intermediatesubproblem{Prove that an orthogonal projection onto the $\colsp{Q}$ is the same as the sum of the projections onto each column of $Q$.}\spc{10}


\hardsubproblem{Trouble in paradise. Prove that the SSE of a multivariate linear least squares model always decreases (equivalently, $R^2$ always increases) upon the addition of a new independent predictor. Keep in mind this holds true even if this new predictor has no information about the true causal inputs to the phenomenon $y$.}\spc{12}

\intermediatesubproblem{Why is this a bad thing? Explain in English.}\spc{3}
