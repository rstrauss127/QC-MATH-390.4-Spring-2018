\begin{abstract}
The path to success in this class is to do many problems. Unlike other courses, exclusively doing reading(s) will not help. Coming to lecture is akin to watching workout videos; thinking about and solving problems on your own is the actual ``working out.''  Feel free to \qu{work out} with others; \textbf{I want you to work on this in groups.}

Reading is still \textit{required}. For this homework set, read the first chapter of \qu{Learning from Data}. Also, read about all the concepts introduced in class online. This is your responsibility to supplement in-class with your own readings.

The problems below are color coded: \ingreen{green} problems are considered \textit{easy} and marked \qu{[easy]}; \inorange{yellow} problems are considered \textit{intermediate} and marked \qu{[harder]}, \inred{red} problems are considered \textit{difficult} and marked \qu{[difficult]} and \inpurple{purple} problems are extra credit. The \textit{easy} problems are intended to be ``giveaways'' if you went to class. Do as much as you can of the others; I expect you to at least attempt the \textit{difficult} problems. 

This homework is worth 100 points but the point distribution will not be determined until after the due date. See syllabus for the policy on late homework.

Up to 10 points are given as a bonus if the homework is typed using \LaTeX. Links to instaling \LaTeX~and program for compiling \LaTeX~is found on the syllabus. You are encouraged to use \url{overleaf.com}. If you are handing in homework this way, read the comments in the code; there are two lines to comment out and you should replace my name with yours and write your section. The easiest way to use overleaf is to copy the raw text from hwxx.tex and preamble.tex into two new overleaf tex files with the same name. If you are asked to make drawings, you can take a picture of your handwritten drawing and insert them as figures or leave space using the \qu{$\backslash$vspace} command and draw them in after printing or attach them stapled.

The document is available with spaces for you to write your answers. If not using \LaTeX, print this document and write in your answers. I do not accept homeworks which are \textit{not} on this printout. Keep this first page printed for your records.

\problem{These are questions about Silver's book, the introduction and chapter 1.}

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{What is the difference between \emph{predict} and \emph{forecast}? Are these two terms used interchangably today?}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{What is John P. Ioannidis's findings and what are its implications?}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{What are the human being's most powerful defense (according to Silver)? Answer using the language from class.}\spc{4}


\easysubproblem{Information is increasing at a rapid pace, but what is not increasing?}\spc{3}

\hardsubproblem{Silver admits that we will always be subjectively biased when making predictions. However, he believes there is an objective truth. In class, how did we describe the objective truth? Answer using notation from class i.e. $t,f, g, h^*, \delta, \epsilon, t, z_1, \ldots, z_t, \delta, \mathbb{D}$, $\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, X, y, n, p$, $x_{\cdot 1}, \ldots, x_{\cdot p}, x_{1 \cdot}, \ldots, x_{n \cdot}$, etc.}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{In a nutshell, what is Karl Popper's (a famous philosopher of science) definition of \emph{science}?}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{Why did the ratings agencies say the probability of a CDO defaulting was 0.12\% instead of the 28\% that actually occured? Answer using concepts from class.}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{What is the difference between \emph{risk} and \emph{uncertainty} according to Silver's definitions?}\spc{4}

\hardsubproblem{How does Silver define \emph{out of sample}? Answer using notation from class i.e. $t,f, g, h^*, \delta, \epsilon, t, z_1, \ldots, z_t, \delta, \mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}, X, y, n, p, x_{\cdot 1}, \ldots, x_{\cdot p}, x_{1 \cdot}, \ldots, x_{n \cdot}$, etc. WARNING: Silver defines \emph{out of sample} completely differently than the literature (and differently than practitioners in industry). We will explore what he is talking about in class in the future and we will term this concept differently, using the more widely accepted terminology. So please forget the phrase \emph{out of sample} for now as we will introduce it later in class as something else. There will be other such terms in his book and I will provide this disclaimer at these appropriate times.}\spc{7}

\intermediatesubproblem{Look up \emph{bias} and \emph{variance} online or in a statistics textbook. Connect these concepts to Silver's terms \emph{accuracy} and \emph{precision}. This is another example of Silver using non-standard terminology.}\spc{6}

\problem{Below are some questions about the theory of modeling.}

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{Redraw the illustration from lecture one except do not use the Earth and a table-top globe. In the top right quadrant, you should write \qu{predictions} not \qu{data} (this was my mistake in the notes). \qu{Data / measurements} are reserved for the bottom right quadrant. The quadrants are connected with arrows. Label these arrows appropriately as well..}\spc{12}

\easysubproblem{Pursuant to the fix in the previous question, how do we define \emph{data} for the purposes of this class?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{What is the difference between a "good model" and a "bad model"?}\spc{2}

\end{enumerate}

\problem{We are now going to investigate the aphorism \qu{An apple a day keeps the doctor away}. We will use this as springboard to ask more questions about the framework of modeling we introduced in this class.}

\begin{enumerate}

\intermediatesubproblem{How good / bad do you think this model is and why?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Is this a mathematical model? Yes / no and why.}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{What is(are) the input(s) in this model?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{From this point on, you only observe $x_1$ is in the model. What is $p$ mathematically?}\spc{1}


\intermediatesubproblem{From this point on, you only observe $x_1$ is in the model. What is $\mathcal{X}$ mathematically? If your information contained in $x_1$ is non-numeric, you must coerce it to be numeric at this point.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{How did we term the functional relationship between $y$ and $x_1$?}\spc{3}


\easysubproblem{Briefly describe \emph{superivised learning}.}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{Why is \emph{superivised learning} a \emph{empirical solution} and not an \emph{analytic solution}?}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{From this point on, assume we are involved in supervised learning to achieve the goal you stated in the previous question. Briefly describe what $\mathbb{D}$ would look like here.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{Briefly describe the role of $\mathcal{H}, \mathcal{A}$ here.}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{If $g = \mathcal{A}(\mathbb{D}, \mathcal{H})$, what should the domain and range of $g$ be?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Is $g \in \mathcal{H}$? Why or why not?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Given a never-before-seen value of $x_1$ which we denote $x^*$, what formula would we use to predict the corresponding value of the output? Denote this prediction $\hat{y}^*$.}\spc{3}

\intermediatesubproblem{Is it reasonable to assume $f \in \mathcal{H}$? Why or why not?}\spc{4}

\easysubproblem{If $f \notin \mathcal{H}$, what are the three sources of error? Write their names and provide a sentence explanation of each. Note that I made a notational mistake in the notes based on what is canonical in data science. The difference $t - g$ should be termed $e$ as the term $\mathcal{E}$ is reserved for $t - h^*$.}\spc{4}

\intermediatesubproblem{For each of the three source of error, provide a means of reducing the error. We discussed this in class.}\spc{4}


\easysubproblem{Regardless of your answer to what $\mathcal{Y}$ was above, we now coerce $\mathcal{Y} = \braces{0,1}$. If we use a threshold model, what would $\mathcal{H}$ be? What would the parameter(s) be?}\spc{3}


\easysubproblem{Give an explicit example of $g$ under the threshold model.}\spc{3}

\end{enumerate}

\problem{These are questions about the linear perceptron. This problem is not related to problem 3.}

\easysubproblem{If $\Xoneton \iid \bernoulli{\theta}$, find the likelihood, $\mathcal{L}$, of $\theta$.}\spc{2}

But try to do it yourself.} \spc{20}


\end{enumerate}

\problem{We will review the frequentist perspective here.}

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{What are the three goals of inference? Give short explanations.}\spc{5}

You need the continuous mapping theorem and Slutsky's theorem.

\intermediatesubproblem{In class we presented the posterior odds form of Bayes Theorem. Prove it below.}\spc{10}


\intermediatesubproblem{Show that the Bayes Factor is the ratio of posterior odds of the hypothesis to prior odds of the hypothesis.}\spc{2}

\easysubproblem{On the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor}{wikipedia page about Bayes Factors}, Harrold Jeffreys (who we will be returning to later in the semester) gave interpretations of Bayes Factors (which is denoted $K$ there and $B$ in Bolstad's book on page 70). Give the ranges of $K$ here (not in terms of powers of 10, but as a pure number) for his interpretations i.e. \qu{negative,} \qu{strong,} etc.}\spc{3}

\hardsubproblem{[MA] Conceptually why should the likelihood being greater than $\prob{A}$ imply that the hypothesis is more likely after observing the data than before?}\spc{6}
\end{enumerate}

\problem{We examine here paternity testing (i.e. answering the question \qu{is this guy the father of my child?}) via the simplistic test using blood types. These days, more advanced genetic methods exist so these calculations aren't made in practice, but they are a nice exercise. 

First a crash course on basic genetics. In general, everyone has two alleles (your genotype) with one coming from your mother and one coming from your father. The mother passes on each of the alleles with 50\% probability and the father passes on each allele with 50\% probability. One allele gets expressed (your phenotype). So one of the genes shone through (the dominant one) and one was masked (the recessive one). Dominant blood types are A and B and the recessive type is o (lowercase letter). The only way to express phenotype o is to have genotype oo i.e. both genes are o. There is an exception; A and B are codominant meaning that blood type AB tests positive for both A and B.

In this case consider a child of blood type B and the mother of blood type A. Using this \href{http://www.cccoe.net/genetics/blood2.html}{hereditary guide}, we know that the mother's type must be Ao so she passed on an o to the child thus the child got the B from the father. Thus the father had type AB, BB or Bo. I got the following data from \href{http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1110863011000796}{this paper} (so let's assume this case is in Nigeria in 1998).

\begin{table}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{cc}
Genotype & Frequency \\ \hline
OO	&0.52 \\
AA	&0.0196 \\
AO	&0.2016 \\
BB	&0.0196 \\
BO	&0.2016 \\
AB	&0.0392 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
} 

\begin{enumerate}

\easysubproblem{Bob is the alleged father and he has blood type B but his genotype is unknown. What is the probability he passes on a B to the child?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{What is the probability a stranger passes on a B to the child?}\spc{3}

\easysubproblem{Assume our prior is 50-50 Bob is the father, the customary compromise between a possibly bitter mother and father. What is the prior odds of Bob being the father? Don't think too hard about this one; it is marked easy for a reason.}\spc{6}

\hardsubproblem{We are interested in the posterior question. What is the probability Bob is the father given the child with blood type B?}\spc{5}

\hardsubproblem{What is the Bayes Factor here? See (a) and (b).}\spc{5}

\easysubproblem{What is the probability Bob is not the father given the child with blood type B? Should be easy once you have (c) and (e).}\spc{3}
